Find all file from your upload folder that are not used or simple not refered in the database of the wordpress site. 

== Description ==

This plugin will help you to find all file that are not used and not refered in your wordpress site, but that are in the upload folder.

Maybe one day you installed one plugin/theme, this one made a war of files in your wordpress site, and at this moment this plugin/theme is not used anymore, and you want to find and delete all this file, well this plugin is for you.

For the moment, this plugin only work with one wordpress new site, if you use others plugin, maybe the plugin will take some file like is not used or not refered, but it is!! So be careful!!!.

*Recommendations*

* Make a BACKUP of your uploads folder, because for the moment the plugin will delete the information from your server,they are irreversible, so if something goes wrong is better have a backup.
* Performs a lots of tests before use in production site, try to use blogs with the same characteristics, since I have not tested for compatibility with other plugin, so you can see if will work fine (see more in the https://wordpress.org/plugins/dnui-delete-not-used-image-wordpress/faq/ ).
* Download this plugin only from wordpress.org.

*WARNING*
ASK FIRST, IF YOU DONT KNOW THE FILE THAT YOU WANT DELETE, BECAUSE CAN BE USEFUL FOR OTHER PLUGIN OR THEME.
